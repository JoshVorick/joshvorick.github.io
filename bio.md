Hi, I'm Josh Vorick. I'm a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Technically I've been programming since my freshman year of high school, but I didn't really start 
pursuing it outside of the classroom until part way through junior year when I learned C++ and began
work on [The Koala Game](https://github.com/JoshVorick/KoalaGame). Since then I've created much more
elegant and impressive programs, most notably my [sandbox particle simulator](https://github.com/JoshVorick/FunWithParticles)
and [interactive fractal viewer](https://github.com/JoshVorick/VisualizingComplexFunctions).

I've been doing Tae Kwon Do for over 11 years and I've been an Instructor for the past 7.
I also love to play a pickup game of soccer whenever I can.

Some of my skills include a strong knowledge of C, Java, C++, and Python. I've also got a pretty
good handle on Haskell and Go. I have experience with some simple multithreading, and some computer
vision. Right now I'm working on making a [Lip Reader](https://github.com/JoshVorick/LipReader).

During my years as a Tae Kwon Do instructor, I've played a variety of leadership roles. For the year and
a half before I left for college, I was the head instructor for our YMCA and Park District programs.
I've also has experience working in small teams with other Instructors to manage large classes as well
as very large teams for testings which were sometimes as large as 150 students and as long as 6 hours.

Last summer I worked as an intern at [PCTEL](https://www.antenna.com). As the Product Management Intern I
designed and created a Product Concept Form for sales persons to fill out if a customer wanted us to
sell a new type of antenna. After creating an interactive form using Excel and VBScript, I put together
a program that would track the success of these products and compare their actual success against the
success predicted by the sales person. This way, the product management team could make more informed
decisions on which products to pursue.

###The Future

Although I don't have any spectacularly specific plans for the future, yet. I know I want to find
something that I not only enjoy doing, but that I also believe will change the world for the better.
I'm still not quite sure what future will satisfy these two conditions, but I hope to investigate
different potential career paths and find one that I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.
